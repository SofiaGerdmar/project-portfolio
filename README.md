# Project Portfolio
A project made to showcase the abilities aquired and the projects made about half-way through the bootcamp.

## The problem
The biggest mistake I made was to not make this "mobile first". It lead to a lot of headache later, when it was time to make the page responsive. At first I thought about remaking the CSS from scratch, but realized that would mean renaming most of the HTML-classes as well. So I saw it as a lesson learned, and worked with extensive media queries instead. Not the cleanest code possible, but pretty okay for the knowledge I had at the time. (Readme written a couple of months after actually finishing the project.)
